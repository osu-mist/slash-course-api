# Slash Course API

The RESTful API which allows users to view all slash courses. Users can also update or delete slash course data from the database.

## Description

There are two resources in the Slash Course API: **/slash\_courses** and **/slash\_courses/{crn}**
* /slash_courses supports **GET** and **POST**.
    * In GET /slash_course, users are allowed to query all slash courses information or to filter the results by giving parameters (by course name, term or department).
    * In POST /slash_course, users are allowed to add a new course resource. 
* /slash_courses/{crn} supports **GET**, **PUT** and **DELETE**
    * In GET /slash_course/{crn}, users are allowed to query one specific slash course information by CRN.
    * In PUT /slash_course/{crn}, users are allowed to update a new course information by CRN.
    * In DELETE /slash_course/{crn}, users are allowed to delete a existed course object by CRN.

## Installation

You'll need to use [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) to build the API and obtain the `ojdbc6_g.jar` file from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/apps-tech/jdbc-112010-090769.html) and put it into the `bin` directory. In addition, you'll also have to create a `configuration.yaml` file which includes your personal credentials. After finish the process, you can simply run the follow command to activate the API service:<br/>

`gradle run`

By default, the API uses the port `8080`, so in order to test the API locally, you can connect `localhost:8080\` from your browser.

## GET

Retrieve the slash course info from the database.
